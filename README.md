# unit-4-game

This is the Bug Collector game. It is a derivative work based the Crystal Collector game.


To play the game, you must select the correct number of Bugs to have their hidden value equal the displayed number of the screen. Each bug has a random number assigned to that resets at the start of each attempt. If your choices add up to the displayed number without going over, you win! If your choices go over the displayed number, you lose and try again!

Click on a Bug to start the fun!!

This game uses javascript, css, jquery, and bootstrap.
